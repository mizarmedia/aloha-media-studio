## ✅ COMPLETED: CLAUDE-AlohaMediaStudio-20260116-163215
**Date:** 2026-01-16
**Duration:** 25 minutes
**Goal:** Fix project images, deploy to Cloudflare Pages, connect custom domain
**Status:** Completed

### Accomplished:
- Fixed swapped project images (Worth Beyond Wealth / AuthorVoice)
- Fixed Dr. Roger Hall testimonial image cropping (added object-top)
- Set up GitHub repo: mizarmedia/aloha-media-studio
- Created Cloudflare Pages project and deployed site
- Connected custom domain alohamediastudio.com
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow for auto-deploy (blocked by billing)
- Updated project links and descriptions
- Improved text readability with darker overlay on project cards

### Issues Encountered:
- GitHub Actions blocked due to account billing issue - manual deploy works fine

### Learnings:
- Wrangler is available via npx and already authenticated with CLOUDFLARE_* env vars
- Existing Pages project "alohamediastudio" already had custom domain configured

### Stopping Point:
Site is live at alohamediastudio.com. The Lab project still needs YouTube link.

### Next Session:
- Add The Lab YouTube link when available
- Fix GitHub billing to enable auto-deploy
- Review site on mobile devices
