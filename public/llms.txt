# Aloha Media Studio

> Podcast production company in Eagle, Idaho. We help business owners launch podcasts without the headache.

Aloha Media Studio takes care of podcasting so you don't have to figure it out yourself. We handle content strategy, multi-camera recording in our studio, editing, and getting your show on YouTube, Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and everywhere else.

Our team has produced over 500 videos and helped clients hit more than 260,000 views. We work with business owners, consultants, authors, and anyone who wants to become the go-to expert in their space.

## Why Work With Us

Most podcasts die because production is a pain. Recording, editing, thumbnails, show notes, uploading everywhere. It piles up. Business owners don't have time to learn video editing or mess with audio levels.

That's why we exist. We become your podcast team. You focus on what you know. We handle the cameras, lights, mics, editing, and publishing. Working with us means launching a podcast is as easy as showing up and having a conversation.
