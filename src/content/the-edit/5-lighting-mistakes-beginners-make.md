# 5 Lighting Mistakes Every Beginner Makes

Good lighting is the difference between amateur and professional-looking video. The good news? Most lighting mistakes are easy to fix once you know what to look for.

## Mistake #1: Relying on Overhead Lights

**The Problem:** Most rooms have overhead lights that cast harsh shadows under your eyes and nose—the dreaded "raccoon eyes" effect.

**The Fix:** Turn off the overhead lights and use a key light positioned at a 45-degree angle from your subject. Even a simple ring light or desk lamp can work in a pinch.

## Mistake #2: Shooting with a Window Behind You

**The Problem:** When your light source is behind your subject, the camera exposes for the bright background, leaving your subject as a dark silhouette.

**The Fix:** Face the window instead. Natural window light is beautiful and free. Position your subject so the window is in front of them (behind the camera) or to the side.

## Mistake #3: Mixed Color Temperatures

**The Problem:** Combining daylight (blue) with indoor lights (orange) creates an unflattering, confusing look that's hard to color correct.

**The Fix:** Choose one or the other. Either close the blinds and use artificial light, or turn off the indoor lights and use natural light. If you must mix, use daylight-balanced bulbs.

## Mistake #4: Harsh, Direct Light

**The Problem:** A bare bulb or direct sunlight creates hard shadows and unflattering highlights on skin.

**The Fix:** Diffuse your light. You can use a softbox, shoot through a white bedsheet, or bounce light off a white wall or ceiling. Soft light is forgiving and flattering.

## Mistake #5: Forgetting About Background Light

**The Problem:** Lighting only your subject while leaving the background dark creates a "floating head" effect.

**The Fix:** Add separation with a background light or hair light. Even a small accent light behind your subject can add depth and make your video look more polished.
